      <p><strong>Welcome!</strong> My name is Richa Laddha and I am a senior at Blue Valley Northwest High School. </p>
      <p>My hobbies include photography, art, and baking. I love traveling the world, experiencing once <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a lifetime opportunities. My passion for photography started as I captured pictures of <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beautiful sceneries on family vacations. Wanting to continue my zeal for photography, I became <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a photographer for the school yearbook - BVNW Horizon. I love capturing moments that can <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also be cherished later. Pictures can take you back to any moment which is why I find being <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a photographer so remarkable. Wanting to further my skills and mentor new photographers,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I became the chief photographer for the yearbook. I enjoy my role in the yearbook and hope to <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue photography wherever I go in the future. Combining my photography skills and my <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;business knowledge, I founded my own photography business, RiL Photography, taking portrait <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and senior pictures. This has allowed me to share my skills in photography so others can cherish <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;photography as well. Check out more information in the Services section.  </p>

      <p>Art has been in my life since I was young and I love creating art with different mediums. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although acrylic and oil pastels are my favorite, each medium has led me to grow as an artist. </p>
      <p>As you go through my website, you can find a collection of my work. </p>
